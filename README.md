# Capstone Project - Swire Coca Cola 

## 1 . Business Problem and Project Objective

Swire Coca-Cola faces significant production challenges due to frequent unplanned machine downtimes across its six manufacturing plants, resulting in the company achieving only 94.4% of the production needed to meet order demands.
These downtimes, which contribute to an estimated $60 million in annual losses, are linked to factors such as specific machine types, plant locations, and equipment categories. 
Addressing these high-risk areas is crucial to mitigating the impact of production shortfalls.
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive maintenance strategy to proactively address unplanned equipment failures.
By predicting and preventing downtimes, Swire Coca-Cola can improve production efficiency, minimize emergency repair costs, and ensure timely order fulfillment. 
This approach will also enable the company to optimize maintenance schedules, strategically stock critical spare parts, and reduce response times, ultimately enhancing operational reliability and financial performance.
